Welcome to TuneTracker!

TuneTracker allows you to keep track of music you've listened to in a concise, centralized location.
TuneTracker also provides you with the top tagged albums for many genres, as well as providing you with 
a list of randomly selected albums for the chosen genre for when you want to listen to something new.

This app uses the Last.fm API to search albums by name as well as get top albums by tag. The randomize feature
is a modified version of getTopAlbumsByTag using a randomly generated number to get a random page of albums. 

Future improvements:
  - More genres
  - Individual song functionality
  - Favorites

The most difficult part of this app was creating the search and getTopAlbums functionality. Building the API request and then decoding
was very tricky, and it took me a while to figure out how to properly display the albums in a list format.
